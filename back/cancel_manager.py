"""Simple cancellation registry for form processing tasks.

The frontend can request to *cancel* any ongoing processing for a particular
``form_path`` via the `/form/cancel` endpoint.  All backend endpoints that do
significant work on a form should call :pyfunc:`is_cancelled` **at the very
start** and abort early if cancellation has been requested.

At the moment this is implemented as an in-memory set protected by a thread
lock.  This is sufficient because the current FastAPI application runs inside
one Python process.  If the backend gets distributed across multiple worker
processes in the future, this logic should be replaced with a process-shared
store (e.g. Redis, database or file lock).
